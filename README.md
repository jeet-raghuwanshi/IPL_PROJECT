this project analyzes the performance of IPL cricketers to create an ideal T20 team. The code imports libraries, reads data from CSV files, and preprocesses it. The players are classified into four categories: batters, all-rounders, bowlers, and wicket-keepers. The top performers in each category are identified based on their respective performance metrics.

The final eleven includes:

1. Batters:
   - KL Rahul
   - David Warner
   - Virat Kohli

2. All-rounders:
   - Andre Russell
   - Sunil Narine
   - Hardik Pandya

3. Bowlers:
   - Yuzvendra Chahal
   - Jasprit Bumrah
   - Nathan Coulter-Nile
   - Kagiso Rabada

4. Wicket-keeper:
   - MS Dhoni

Various performance metrics are visualized for each category using bar plots. The final team is created by concatenating the top performers from each category and removing irrelevant columns.
